      # We need the image for the lakom admisison controller to be injected 
      # into the vectorImageOverwrite for the controller registration.
      # Skaffold currently does not give us an easy way to access the 
      # image name of the newly built lakom during deployment (eg. passing it
      # to kustomize).
      #
      # Hooks(https://skaffold.dev/docs/lifecycle-hooks/), however, provide us
      # environment variables that contain the needed values:
      # - SKAFFOLD_IMAGE_REPO
      # - SKAFFOLD_IMAGE_TAG
      #
      # For this reason, using a post-build hook we can inject the image name and
      # image tag into a patch file for kustomize, which will be triggered during
      # the deployment phase of skaffold.
      #
      # The script file simply creates the needed resource patch for kustomize.
