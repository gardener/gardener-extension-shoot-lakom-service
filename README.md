Project Gardener implements the automated management and operation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters as a service.
Its main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks.

Recently, most of the vendor specific logic has been developed [in-tree](https://github.com/gardener/gardener).
However, the project has grown to a size where it is very hard to extend, maintain, and test.
With [GEP-1](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md) we have proposed how the architecture can be changed in a way to support external controllers that contain their very own vendor specifics.
This way, we can keep Gardener core clean and independent.

This controller implements Gardener's extension contract for the `shoot-lakom-service` extension.

An example for a `ControllerRegistration` resource that can be used to register this controller to Gardener can be found [here](example/controller-registration.yaml).

Please find more information regarding the extensibility concepts and a detailed proposal [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md).

## Lakom Admission Controller

Lakom is kubernetes admission controller which purpose is to implement [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) image signature verification against public cosign key. It also takes care to resolve image tags to sha256 digests. It also caches all OCI artifacts to reduce the load toward the OCI registry.

## Extension Resources

Example extension resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: extension-shoot-lakom-service
  namespace: shoot--project--abc
spec:
  type: shoot-lakom-service
```

When an extension resource is reconciled, the extension controller will create an instance of `lakom` admission controller. These resources are placed inside the shoot namespace on the seed. Also, the controller takes care about generating necessary `RBAC` resources for the seed as well as for the shoot.

Please note, this extension controller relies on the [Gardener-Resource-Manager](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/resource-manager.md) to deploy k8s resources to seed and shoot clusters.

## How to start using or developing this extension controller locally

The `Lakom` admission controller can be configured with `make dev-setup` and started with `make start-lakom`.
You can run the lakom extension controller locally on your machine by executing `make start`.

If you'd like to develop Lakom using a local cluster such as KinD, make sure your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is targeting the local Garden cluster.
Add `127.0.0.1 registry.local.gardener.cloud` to your `/etc/hosts`. You can then run:

```bash
make extension-up
```

This will trigger a skaffold deployment that builds the images, pushes them to the registry and installs the helm charts from `/charts`.

If you are running local Gardener operator, then it is more appropriate to run the command:

```bash
make extension-operator-up
```

We are using Go modules for Golang package dependency management and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)/[Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) for testing.
