# Introduction

This extension implements [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) image verification. It is strictly limited only to the kubernetes system components deployed by Gardener and other Gardener Extensions in the `kube-system` namespace of a shoot cluster.

## Shoot Feature Gate

In most of the Gardener setups the `shoot-lakom-service` extension is enabled globally and thus can be configured per shoot cluster. Please adapt the shoot specification by the configuration shown below to disable the extension individually.

```yaml
kind: Shoot
...
spec:
  extensions:
  - type: shoot-lakom-service
    disabled: true
...
```
